The MPDM is aimed at realizing a number of Eclipse plugins implementing different domain specific languages and transformations enabling:

  * the modeling of WBS;
  * the modeling of resources and groups of resources;
  * the modeling of project plans and schedules;
  * the automatic generation of documents such as the Project Management Plan (PMP);
  * other PM related tools (i.e. Resources Occupation Analysis, Costs Analysis, etc.)

The Project is currently in a pre-alpha state you can already find some working code in the repository.

We are finishing to implement the basic set of functionalities for a first alpha release and, in the meanwhile, writing some documentation and tutorials.
